This was from the first playtesting I had done for my level. A lot of the responses were about the need for more deatil in the center area, more gun locations and just generally more for those side rooms which lead to me adding some explosive barrels and weapons within those side rooms.

For this version there was just a few asks for some changes for more ways to the second floor so I will add that along with more larger objects within those side rooms to block a bit more view of players.
