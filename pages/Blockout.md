## Focus

For this Block out I wanted to have a huge arena that players would mostly meet at and give some rewards for them in three rooms that lead out of the main area along with some places for players to spawn in. 
The idea streams for the center area being a sort of arena that players will meet and battle at, where the other hallways are areas for players to explore and be rewarded with weapons and maybe even gear to help them come back into the center to fight.
