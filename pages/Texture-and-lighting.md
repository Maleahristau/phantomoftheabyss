For this level I wanted it to fit the name, "Phantom of the Abyss" the idea being players stubble apon this huge ghost girl's tomb that seems to be nowhere. 
The side rooms are the vents of energy the girl is giving off and of course the main room is her in herself. For the player, that means the main room has a more blue undertone the ghostly hue on everything, whereas the side rooms are warm and red.
As well as the second floor in all of the side rooms have different roof textures to softly tell the story of the Phantom!
